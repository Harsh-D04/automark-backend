Automated Ad Creation:
AutoMark is an AI-driven system that automates the end-to-end process of generating marketing advertisements. Users provide minimal product or campaign information, and the system produces well-structured, relevant ad copies without manual writing.

AI-Based Content Generation:
The platform leverages natural language processing (NLP) and prompt-driven AI workflows to generate human-like ad content. It ensures consistency in tone, clarity in messaging, and relevance to the provided input.

Multiple Ad Variations for Experimentation:
Instead of producing a single ad, AutoMark generates multiple variations, enabling marketers to quickly test different messaging styles, headlines, and call-to-action formats for better performance.

Significant Time & Effort Reduction:
By automating repetitive copywriting tasks, AutoMark reduces ad creation time by approximately 65%, allowing teams to focus on strategy, analysis, and optimization rather than manual content writing.

Scalable Full-Stack Architecture:
The system is built with a modular, API-based backend that handles input processing, AI inference, and response management. This design supports scalability and easy integration with frontend applications or external tools.

Backend-Focused Design with Secure APIs:
AutoMark emphasizes backend reliability, secure API handling, and clean data flow. Sensitive credentials and API keys are managed via environment variables and are not exposed in the repository.

Extensible & Future-Ready:
The project is designed to support future enhancements such as ad performance analytics, feedback-driven learning, automated optimization, and platform-specific ad formatting.

Local Execution & Deployment Rationale:
The application is intended to run locally due to AI API security considerations, cost constraints, and controlled access requirements. Clear setup instructions are provided to ensure smooth local execution.
